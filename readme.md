### Things to keep in mind

`/* eslint-disable */` will disable eslint on the next line. if put on the top of the file will disable linting for the entire file. read more at [this link](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring"eslint disable")

use `// eslint-disable-next-line` to disable `eslint` for the next line
